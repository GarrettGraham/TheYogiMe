<p>Yoga allows us to be brought into union with, not only ourselves, but with our environment as a whole. This practice, that has survived for millenia through to the present, is a journey which allows us to calm the chatter of the mind and delve into our very being. By taking time in the day to focus inward, we come closer to discovering the very unique beauty of being. The practice of meditation and movement through the poses allows us to discover peace within ourselve. We may not be able to control the chaotic events that occur externally, but we are certainly able to alter our own thought process. The mind is an extremely powerful tool that may either hinder our efforts or perpetuate success. It is important to acknowledge our conditioned mentality and alter the way in which we speak to ourselve. By accepting our life circumstances and pursuing life in a gentle and humble manner, we are one step closer to discovering the divine beauty that is within us all. Namaste, brave traveler.</p>
